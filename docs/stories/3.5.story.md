# Story 3.5: Configuration and Customization

Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to customize plugin behavior and appearance,
**so that** the plugin integrates seamlessly with my development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Timeout duration is configurable
2. Visual indicator styles can be customized
3. Result file location and naming can be configured
4. Plugin can be disabled for specific file types or directories
5. LazyVim integration provides sensible defaults
6. Configuration changes take effect immediately without restart

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `setup()` options for shell, timeout, indicators, results, env capture, run-all
- [ ] Live-apply config where feasible without restart
- [ ] LazyVim integration examples in README
- [ ] Filetype/directory disable controls

## Dev Notes
- Config structure and defaults documented in "9. Commands, Keymaps, and Config". [Source: architecture.md#9.-Commands,-Keymaps,-and-Config]

### Testing
- Unit: config parsing and defaults; manual: live toggle behavior. [Source: architecture.md#13.-Testing-Strategy]
