# Story 3.3: Enhanced Error Handling and Quickfix Integration

Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** errors integrated with Neovim's quickfix system,
**so that** I can navigate and debug command failures efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Command errors populate Neovim's quickfix list
2. Quickfix entries include file location, command, and error details
3. User can navigate between errors using standard quickfix commands
4. Plugin provides command to open quickfix window with recent errors
5. Error messages are parsed for common patterns (file:line format)
6. Timeout errors are clearly distinguished from command failures

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Populate quickfix with errors on failure and on run-all summary
- [x] Entry format: file, start/end line, command summary, first stderr lines
- [x] Provide `:MarkdownRunQuickfix` command
- [x] Parse timeouts separately from non-zero exits

## Dev Notes
- Quickfix integration described in "8. UI & UX Integration â€“ Quickfix". [Source: architecture.md#8.-UI-&-UX-Integration]

### Testing
- Integration: quickfix entries created and navigable; timeout vs failure distinction. [Source: architecture.md#13.-Testing-Strategy]
