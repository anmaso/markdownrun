# Story 2.5: Visual Execution Status Indicators

Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see visual indicators of which blocks have been executed,
**so that** I can track my progress through the document.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Plugin uses virtual text to mark executed blocks with status indicators
2. Different visual styles for: not executed, executing, success, failed
3. Indicators are non-intrusive and don't interfere with editing
4. Visual markers update in real-time during execution
5. Markers persist across editor sessions when results file exists
6. User can toggle visual indicators on/off

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement extmark-based indicator system in `lua/markdownrun/feedback.lua`
- [x] Define default symbols and highlight groups; make configurable
- [x] Real-time updates on state transitions
- [x] Rehydrate indicators from results on buffer open
- [x] Toggle command `:MarkdownRunToggleIndicators`
