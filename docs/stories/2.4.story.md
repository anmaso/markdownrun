# Story 2.4: Execute All Blocks Mode

Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to execute all code blocks in the file sequentially,
**so that** I can run complete automation workflows with one command.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Plugin executes all shell code blocks in document order
2. Execution stops immediately if any command fails (non-zero exit code)
3. Plugin provides progress feedback during batch execution
4. User can cancel batch execution while in progress
5. Plugin summarizes results of batch execution (success/failure counts)
6. Failed executions provide clear error location and details

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `:MarkdownRunAll` orchestrator with stop-on-error
- [x] Progress feedback and cancellation
- [ ] Summary popup and quickfix error entries

## Dev Notes
- See "10. Core Flows â€“ Execute all" and quickfix integration in "8. UI & UX Integration". [Source: architecture.md#10.-Core-Flows] [Source: architecture.md#8.-UI-&-UX-Integration]

### Testing
- Integration: success/failure counts; cancellation path; stop-on-error behavior. [Source: architecture.md#13.-Testing-Strategy]
