# Story 3.4: Global Shortcuts and Command Interface

Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** convenient keyboard shortcuts for all plugin functions,
**so that** I can use the plugin efficiently without disrupting my editing flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Plugin provides default keybindings for all major functions
2. Keybindings are configurable by users
3. Plugin commands are accessible via Neovim's command interface
4. Tab completion works for plugin commands
5. Plugin provides help command showing all available shortcuts
6. Shortcuts work consistently across different buffer types

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define default keymaps in setup; allow override
- [x] Register commands for all functions and ensure completion
- [x] Provide help command or `:h markdownrun` doc
- [ ] Ensure keymaps only active in markdown buffers

## Dev Notes
- Refer to command list and setup in "9. Commands, Keymaps, and Config". [Source: architecture.md#9.-Commands,-Keymaps,-and-Config]

### Testing
- Manual verification for keymaps; unit test command completion if feasible. [Source: architecture.md#13.-Testing-Strategy]
