# Story 2.3: Execute Next Block Mode

Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to execute the next unexecuted code block in the file,
**so that** I can step through commands sequentially without manual cursor movement.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Plugin identifies the next unexecuted code block from current cursor position
2. Plugin moves cursor to the next block and executes it
3. Plugin provides visual indication of which block will be executed next
4. Plugin handles end-of-file gracefully when no more blocks exist
5. Plugin skips already-executed blocks unless forced to re-execute
6. User can restart from the beginning or continue from current position

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `:MarkdownRunNext` behavior and indicator of next target
- [x] Maintain executed block index based on results `block_id`
- [x] Cursor navigation and EOF handling
- [x] Force re-execute option
