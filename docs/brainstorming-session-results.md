**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ core concepts and implementation decisions

### Key Themes Identified:

- Environment persistence and directory tracking
- Non-intrusive visual feedback using neovim capabilities
- Clear separation of concerns between markdown and results
- Async execution with configurable timeouts
- Extensible architecture for future language support

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 15 min
**Description:** Breaking down the fundamental requirements and core workflow

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Execute code blocks in markdown files and track results
2. Cursor-based interaction model for block selection
3. Results stored in separate .result file (not modifying original)
4. Visual markers in markdown to indicate execution status
5. Popup/message display for immediate feedback
6. Asynchronous execution with non-intrusive notifications
7. Virtual text capabilities for marking executed blocks

**Insights Discovered:**
- Core workflow: Execute → Track → Display → Mark → Async
- Markdown file ↔ Results file relationship is fundamental
- Need for non-intrusive visual indicators
- Cursor-based interaction feels natural for vim users

**Notable Connections:**
- Virtual text capabilities align perfectly with neovim's strengths
- Async execution prevents editor blocking
- Separate results file maintains markdown file integrity

### What If Scenarios - 10 min
**Description:** Exploring different execution scenarios and batch operations

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Multiple execution results comparison (decided: manual backup approach)
2. Batch execution of multiple code blocks
3. Sequential execution with error-gating
4. Selective subset execution of code blocks
5. Three distinct working modes: manual, next-block, execute-all

**Insights Discovered:**
- Sequential execution with error-stopping is more practical than historical tracking
- Batch execution is a killer feature for automation workflows
- Need for flexible execution modes for different use cases

**Notable Connections:**
- Error-gating prevents cascading failures in automation
- Multiple execution modes serve different workflow needs
- Subset selection adds workflow flexibility

### SCAMPER Method - 20 min
**Description:** Systematic enhancement of the three working modes concept

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Three working modes: manual block selection, execute next block, execute all blocks
2. Language-specific executors with prefix/suffix wrapping
3. Sensible defaults to eliminate boilerplate configuration
4. Environment persistence with directory change tracking
5. No environment reset between executions
6. No specification of execution contexts per block

**Insights Discovered:**
- Three-mode approach creates perfect workflow hierarchy
- Language-specific executors extend shell model elegantly
- Environment persistence makes sequential execution powerful
- Sensible defaults reduce configuration burden

**Notable Connections:**
- Language executors use same shell execution foundation
- Environment persistence enables complex automation workflows
- Configuration defaults improve adoption

### Question Storming - 15 min
**Description:** Identifying key implementation challenges and design decisions

**Ideas Generated:**
1. 30-second configurable timeout for non-terminating commands
2. No user input expected from commands
3. Global shortcuts for all plugin commands
4. LazyVim integration priority
5. Relative paths resolve to markdown file directory
6. Multiple vim instances can share same results file
7. No dry run functionality
8. Different visual styling for executed vs unexecuted blocks
9. Large output (>100 lines) saved to separate files
10. Modified code blocks lose association with old results
11. No undo functionality for executions
12. Neovim-only if advanced features needed
13. JSON format for results file
14. Binary data detection and separate file storage
15. No command blacklisting or safety guardrails
16. Quickfix integration for errors
17. Neovim configuration best practices
18. Initially shell-only, no other languages

**Insights Discovered:**
- Clear boundaries and constraints simplify implementation
- Neovim-only approach enables advanced features
- JSON results format provides structure and extensibility
- No safety guardrails puts responsibility on user

**Notable Connections:**
- Configuration decisions eliminate complexity
- Neovim focus enables virtual text and modern features
- JSON format supports future enhancements
- Clear scope prevents feature creep
